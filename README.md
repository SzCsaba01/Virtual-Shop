# Virtual-Shop
I connected a database with Java. The project is an electrical store system, there are 2 types of users, administrators and customers, administrators can add and remove items and customers, the customer must register and log in first to use the application. The customer can choose between the items and can buy them and the purchase details will be saved in the database.
